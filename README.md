# JAK KV Attendance App

Thoughts:

- Is expo-dev-client needed to be removed for production? or is it done automatically? What about the package being in package.json? Does it need to be uninstalled?
- Is react strict mode enabled by default?
- Do I push the eas.json to the repo? What about the project-id in app.json?
